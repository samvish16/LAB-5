  <!-- Addendum explaining stylistic choices -->
  <h2>Addendum: Stylistic Choices</h2>
  <p>Several stylistic choices were made to enhance the readability and visual appeal of the webpage:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Font Choices:</strong> 'Sacramento' was chosen for its elegant and decorative script style. The font size is set to 20px for headings and 16px for paragraphs to ensure readability.</li>
    <li><strong>Color Choices:</strong> The main text color is black (#000), while subheadings are light gray (#999) to provide a balance between aesthetics and readability. The gradient background enhances contrast with the text.</li>
    <li><strong>Border and Padding:</strong> A border of 2px solid black and padding of 10px is applied to the entire document to create a clear separation between the content and the edges of the browser window.</li>
    <li><strong>Heading and Text Sizes:</strong> The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag is used for the title for its prominence, while <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags are used for subheadings and paragraphs, respectively, to maintain a hierarchical structure. Font sizes have been adjusted for readability and visual appeal.</li>
